      Every spot needs a "day" number matching the day list above and a "slot" of Morning, Afternoon, or Evening,
      and must respect the exact Food/Attraction counts specified for that day.
      Every one of the ${totalSpots} spots must be a distinct, unique place — never reuse the same name or address
      more than once across the whole itinerary, even on different days or slots. If the raw data below does not
      contain enough unique candidates to fill every slot without repetition, pick the closest remaining distinct
      options rather than repeating one that was already used.

      Be accurate about dietary and accessibility claims rather than assuming compliance:
      - Only state a specific accommodation in a spot's notes (e.g. "has a dedicated gluten-free menu") if there is
        real supporting evidence in the raw Places data or Reddit excerpts below — do not invent accommodation claims.
      - Distinguish a place being naturally compatible with a broad category (e.g. a coffee shop or bakery
        naturally has some vegan-friendly items like black coffee or fruit, a salad place is naturally
        vegetarian-friendly) from a genuine specialized accommodation (e.g. a dedicated gluten-free bakery,
        a restaurant with a certified allergen-free kitchen) — don't overstate the former as if it were the latter.
      - If no candidate place has strong evidence of meeting a REQUIRED constraint, choose the most plausible
        match by cuisine or place type rather than fabricating certainty in the notes.
      Each raw place below may include a "reviewEvidence" array — these are terms from your constraints above that
      were actually found mentioned in that specific place's real customer reviews (computed directly from the
      review text, not a guess). For REQUIRED constraints, strongly prefer places whose reviewEvidence includes
      that exact term over ones without it; only pick a place lacking evidence if no candidate has any. For
      preferred terms, treat reviewEvidence as a positive signal but not mandatory.` : ''}

      through your choices, not by changing spot counts: Packed means picking spots close together and efficient

      worrying about tight geographic clustering.` : ''}

      Each place below may include "regularOpeningHours.weekdayDescriptions" — its hours per day of the week. Avoid
      scheduling a spot on a day/slot when it would be closed, based on those hours and the day-of-week given above
      for each day; if hours aren't provided or dates aren't specific, use your best judgment.
      Take the day of week into account in your notes where it matters (e.g. weekend crowds, weekday quiet hours,
      brunch on a Sunday, nightlife on a Friday) when specific dates are given above.
      Also consider any well-known public holidays or observances that fall on these exact dates (e.g. Canada Day,
      Independence Day, Thanksgiving) from your own knowledge, even if not listed below. If a real dated event
      (from the list below, or a well-known holiday) is happening, either feature it as an Attraction spot using
      its given coordinates, or mention it in a nearby spot's notes (e.g. expect fireworks or crowds nearby that evening).
